This projects makes practical the use of the `openssl` scripts to build and manage a certificate authority (CA).

Tested initially on Ubuntu 16.04 (inside an aws ec2 instance built with https://github.com/paulojeronimo/gs-rest-service-aws[this scripts]) and in conjunction with https://github.com/paulojeronimo/gs-rest-service-certificate[gs-rest-service-certificate] project.

== Install

Before use the following commands, install the functions into your `.bashrc` file:

----
echo "source $PWD/functions" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
----

The following command will call a function (the code is inside the link:functions[] script) that will configure the file `openssl.cnf` like needed.

----
openssl_init
----

== Generate

To create a new CA, follow the steps required in the execution of the next command:

----
ca -newca
----

After the execution of this command, a directory structure like this will be created:

----
$ tree ca
ca
|-- cacert.pem
|-- careq.pem
|-- certs
|-- crl
|-- index.txt
|-- index.txt.attr
|-- index.txt.old
|-- newcerts
|   `-- C145AA910B0C9FE8.pem
|-- private
|   `-- cakey.pem
`-- serial

4 directories, 8 files
----

== Sign a CSR

The following command takes a CSR file generated in `gs-rest-service-certificate` project and signs the CSR producing a certificate.

----
openssl ca -in ../gs-rest-service-certificate/generated/gs-rest-service.paulojeronimo.com.csr
----

This will produce a change inside the directory structure of the CA, like this:

----
$ tree ca
ca
|-- cacert.pem
|-- careq.pem
|-- certs
|-- crl
|-- index.txt
|-- index.txt.attr
|-- index.txt.attr.old
|-- index.txt.old
|-- newcerts
|   |-- C145AA910B0C9FE8.pem
|   `-- C145AA910B0C9FE9.pem
|-- private
|   `-- cakey.pem
|-- serial
`-- serial.old

4 directories, 11 files
----

In this example of execution, the files that needs to be send to the project `gs-rest-service-certificate` are `ca/cacert.pem` and the generated certificate: `ca/newcerts/C145AA910B0C9FE9.pem`. So, the following commands could be executed to complete this task:

----
d=../gs-rest-service-certificate/received-from-ca
mkdir -p $d
cp ca/cacert.pem $d/cacert.pem
cp ca/newcerts/C145AA910B0C9FE9.pem $d/gs-rest-service.paulojeronimo.com.crt
----

So after receive these files, the `gs-rest-service-certificate` could import and install the certificate to use it.

== Encrypt

----
tar cfz ca.tar.gz ca/
openssl aes-256-cbc -a -salt -in ca.tar.gz -out ca.tar.gz.ascii
----

== Decrypt

----
openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -in ca.tar.gz.ascii -out ca.tar.gz
tar xfz ca.tar.gz
----
